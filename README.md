# BPF-perftool üèéÔ∏è

This repository follows the same rules of `libbpf-boostrap`.

## Configure the environment üí°

1. Clone repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andreagit97/BPF-perftool.git
```

2. Configure the libbpf submodule:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Requirements

* `libelf`
* `zlib`
* kernel version `>=4.17` (we use raw tracepoints)
* if you cannot use the `bpftool` in this repo, you need to have it installed and change the makefile according to its location, or move it to the `tool` directory

## Build and Run a supported application üèóÔ∏è

1. As a first thing, you need to compile the `stats` executable

```bash
cd src
make stats
```

2. You need to put in the `scap-open` directory, the `scap-open` executable and the elf file `probe.o` for the old probe. Compile it from this branch:

```bash
https://github.com/Andreagit97/libs/tree/test_bpf
```

3. You need to compile the `stress-tester` executable:

```bash
cd stress-tester
gcc syscall_generator.c -o exp
```

Please note: the executable must be called `exp` because our eBPF tracepoints will search for that executable name!

4. Now you should be ready to run the perftool:

```bash
cd src
# modern bpf
sudo ./stats --syscall_id 2 --args --modern_bpf --tp 0 --tp 1 --ppm_sc 5   
# old bpf
sudo ./stats --syscall_id 2 --args --bpf ../scap-open/probe.o --tp 0 --tp 1 --ppm_sc 5 

#On another terminal you can run the stress-tester with this command
./exp <syscall-id> # for example if you want to run it for the `open` `./exp 2`
```

With you can `sudo ./stats --help` see the menu.

## Bpftool

Enable stats:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w kernel.bpf_stats_enabled=1
```

Check stats during execution:

```bash
sudo bpftool prog show | grep <sys-e>
```
